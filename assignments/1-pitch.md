# Semester Project: Story Pitch

Prepare a pitch for a story you want to develop over the course of this semester. You can pitch an entirely new story, or pick up one of your previous projects done in print and go deeper into the story.

The format of the presentation is up to you, but a strong pitch should try to answer these main questions:

* What is it you want to do?
* Why do you want to do it?
* How will you do it?
* Why do it now?

You'll present on February 3rd.
