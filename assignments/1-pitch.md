# Semester Project: Story Pitch

Prepare a pitch for a story you want to develop over the course of this semester. You can pitch an entirely new story, or pick up one of your previous projects done in print and go deeper into the story.

The format of the presentation is up to you, but a strong pitch should try to answer these main questions:

* What is it you want to do?
* Why do you want to do it?
* How will you do it?
* Why do it now?

Your presentation should be 4 minutes long and you're open to structure it however you like. If you do choose to pick up a previous project, you should bring in a PDF or printed version of the project so I can see what you've accomplished previously.

You'll present on February 10th.
