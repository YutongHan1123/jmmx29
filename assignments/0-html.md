# HTML Resume

For your first weekly assignment, you will create a web-version of your résumé using only HTML. You should make use of the different HTML tags shown in class to organize the content of the resume.

Your résumé should include the following:

* Your name in an `h1` heading at the top of the page.
* Heading tags for all sections. You should avoid repeating the `h1` tag on a page, but the rest you can reuse as many times as you want.
* A paragraph about yourself. Think of the text that may accompany your portrait if you were to be the keynote speaker for your favorite event. (It does not have to be extremely formal!)

Here are some relevant resources to help you get into things:

1. [The HTML notes](https://github.com/UMInteractive/Weblab/blob/master/notes/2-HTML.md) from CIM111.
1. [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) has great examples on how to use just about any tag.
1. This [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InwH6HWiQ_k6GI23b5PbSHeomp1depr_eX7gWWOOIXY/edit#) is full of links to different tutorials, games, and videos about learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Save your resume as an `index.html` file and **[email](mailto:lennymartinezd@gmail.com)** it to me by the start of next class, January 27. In class, we'll look at some of them and work on the next thing: CSS!
