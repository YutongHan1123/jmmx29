This is a guide to setup your coding environment for the semester. 

## Terminal

The default command line app on mac is `Terminal.app`. You can find it in the Applications folder or you can search for it using Spotlight.

## XCode Command Line Tools

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) made by Apple. You can use it to make apps for the different Apple devices. Their command line tools are easy to install and are used as the basis of other command line software.

To install, copy and paste the following line into your preferred Terminal app.

```bash
xcode-select â€”install
```

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. A package manager is something like an app store &mdash; except everything is free.
