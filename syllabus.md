## Course Description

This course is a seminar designed to introduce interactive data visualization concepts in a web environment. Students will be introduced to code libraries which assist in this task, best practices for interactivity and data visualization. The course will also briefly cover working with data (i.e., how to find sources, cleaning and preparing data for visualizations, etc.).

## Course Objectives

* Learn to use D3.js to make static and interactive visualizations
* Contribute to an open-source project
* Create responsive charts with D3 and React
* HTML & CSS best practices
* Create a simple scrollytelling piece
* Further develop data-driven storytelling skills

## Prerequisites

Comfort with building a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is strongly recommended.

## Materials

### Recommended Books

* [Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3) by Amelia Wattenberger
* [Interactive Data Visualization For the Web](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491921285), Scott Murray

  **Note:** We will be working with D3v5 in the class, but Scott does a great job of walking you through the D3 environment for D3v4 and the changes between D3v4 and D3v5 are minor.

### Optional Books

Books you may find useful as you work through the class:

* [The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics: The Dos and Don’ts of Presenting Data, Facts, and Figures](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393347281/), Dona M. Wong
* [D3.js in Action: Data Visualization with JavaScript, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617294489), Elijah Meeks
* [Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), Marijin Haverbeke
* [The Functional Art](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321834739), [The Truthful Art](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321934075/), [How Charts Lie](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324001569/), by Alberto Cairo

### Software

We will go over installing and setting up all of the following:

* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Github.com
* Github Desktop, Sourcetree
* Visual Studio Code
* Adobe Suite: It is free for students, check [this page](https://www.it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/adobe-creative-cloud/index.html) to set it up.

### Lectures

All lectures will be uploaded to [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV6wDU1l7y6aKGtPoclLU0YzxDV7OZpLB) within 48 hours of class.

## Coursework

### Participation: 20%

Attendance is mandatory. An unexcused absence translates into a zero for that day’s participation; **the two lowest participation grades will be dropped before calculating the final grade.** Students will be expected to participate in discussion every class, and classes will build on one another — you are responsible for the material, even if you must miss class.

### Blog: 5%

In earlier classes you've blogged about your experiences learning about and working on visualizations and visual storytelling. For this class, you should continue blogging. As I talked about it during the first class, these posts don't necessarily have to be long. They can be reflections on something you noticed in the news, or a reminder of how to do something with code so you don't have to Google it every couple of days. By the end of the semester, you should have at least 7 to 8 blog posts.

### Story Teardown: 5%

You will make a 15-minute presentation to the class on an example of data reporting they particularly admire. If possible you should try to interview the journalists who produced the work.

### Weekly Exercises: 30%

As we work in the class, you’ll be recreating your own version of different chart types for practice. These exercises will be collected in a single web project for showcase and will be graded at the end of the semester.

### Semester Project: 40%

You will pitch and build an interactive story of your choosing. We will have various project milestones throughout the semester.

*Graduate Students*: In addition to the project, you need to submit a making-of article describing the development process. The article should be on your personal weblog.

## Grade Scale

I reserve the right to adjust the final grade according to class participation, attendance, overall quality of work, etc.

| Points | Grade |
|:---:|:---:|
|  > 90 | A |
| 80–89 | B |
| 70–79 | C |
| 60–69 | D |
|  ≤ 59 | F |
