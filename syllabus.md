## Course Description

This course is a seminar designed to introduce interactive data visualization concepts in a web environment. Students will be introduced to code libraries which assist in this task, best practices for interactivity and data visualization. The course will also briefly cover working with data (i.e., how to find sources, cleaning and preparing data for visualizations, etc.).

## Class Outcomes

* Learn to use D3.js to make static and interactive visualizations
* Contribute to an open-source project
* Create responsive charts with D3 and React
* HTML & CSS best practices
* Create a simple scrollytelling piece
* Further develop data-driven storytelling skills

## Prerequisites

Intermediate to advanced knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is strongly recommended.

### Software

We will go over installing and setting up all of the following:

* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Github.com
* Github Desktop, Source Tree
* Visual Studio Code
* Adobe Suite: It is free for students, check @@link to adobe suite@@  to set it up.

## Coursework

### Participation: 20%

Attendance is mandatory. An unexcused absence translates into a zero for that day’s participation; *the two lowest participation grades will be dropped before calculating the final grade.* Students will be expected to participate in discussion every class, and classes will build on one another — you are responsible for the material, even if you must miss class.

### Blog: 5%

TODO Expand on this@@

### Story Teardown: 5%

You will make a 15-minute presentation to the class on an example of data reporting they particularly admire. Part of this assignment requires interviewing the journalists who produced the work.

### Weekly Exercises: 30%

As we work in the class, you’ll be recreating your own version of different chart types for practice. These exercises will be collected in a single web project for showcase.

### Semester Project: 40%

You will pitch and build an interactive story of your choosing. We will have various project milestones throughout the semester.

*Graduate Students*: In addition to the project, you need to submit a making-of article describing the development process. The article should be on your personal weblog.

## Grade Scale

I reserve the right to adjust the final grade according to class participation, attendance, overall quality of work, etc.

| Points | Grade |
|:---:|:---:|
| 97–100 | A |
